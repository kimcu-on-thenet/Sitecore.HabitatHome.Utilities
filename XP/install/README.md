## Installation helpers for Sitecore Experience Platform (XP)

> These steps assume you have all of the prerequisites installed or have followed the instructions at [README.md](../../Prerequisits/README.md)

### Solr

Solr can be installed with a script if you do not already have it.

Still in an elevated PowerShell session:

- Browse to the solr folder

  ```powershell
  Set-Location Sitecore.Habitathome.Utilities\XP\Install\solr
  ```

- Review the `install-solr.ps1` script to ensure the Java and Solr versions are correct

- Install Solr

  ```powershell
  .\install-solr.ps1
  ```

> Once setup is complete, the installer should load the solr 'home' page

### Prepare to install XP

```
Set-Location ..
```

#### A bit about the process

The `install-xp0.ps1` script takes in a JSON configuration file (defaults to `.\configuration-xp0.json`) and runs through the entire platform installation, including optional modules.

The `configuration-xp0.json` is generated by running two powershell scripts. These powershell scripts use a template settings file (`install-settings.json`) and populates some values.

The `set-installation-defaults.ps1` does what it sounds like - it creates the `configuration-xp0.json` file and populates it with the default values based on the version of the platform it was meant to support.

The `set-installation-overrides.ps1.example` script needs to be renamed and modified. Executing it once it has been renamed will fill in the rest of the information in the `configuration-xp0.json` file as well as override some of the default values.

----------

#### Installation

- Set some predefined defaults
  ```
	.\set-installation-defaults.ps1
	```

- Create a copy of the overrides file
  ```
	copy set-installation-overrides.ps1.example set-installation-overrides.ps1
	```

- Edit **`set-installation-overrides.ps1`** to set the SQL instance name and sa password

- Apply overrides
  ```
	.\set-installation-overrides.ps1
	```

- Copy your license file to the `.\assets` folder
  ```
	copy ~\Downloads\license.xml .\assets
	```

- Let's GO!
  ```
  .\install-xp0.ps1
  ```
